The Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) is a distributed operating system based on the <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Mesos</a> distributed systems kernel. It integrates several battle-tested [open-source components][1] to enable the management of multiple machines as if they were a single computer. The combination of scalability, availability, efficiency, flexibility, and usability makes DCOS the best way to build, deploy, and manage modern applications.

## Scalability

DCOS dynamically distributes tasks and programmatically manages resource allocations, enabling your services to be both highly elastic and highly scalable.

## Availability

DCOS monitors the health of your applications and services, load balancing, restarting, or even rescheduling them when necessary to make them highly available.

## Efficiency

DCOS supports many custom schedulers, sharing resources between diverse collocated workloads including microservices, batch jobs, analytics pipelines, message queues, and big data storage.

## Flexibility

DCOS can be installed on-premise or in the public cloud, on bare metal or on virtual machines, to run containers or legacy binaries, freeing you from making infrastructure decisions based purely on platform lock-in.

## Usability

DCOS simplifies the installation, management, and monitoring of the cluster and its distributed services with a scriptable command-line interface (CLI), intuitive web interface, and easy-to-use installer.

## A Solid Foundation

Build your applications and services on top of industry standard cloud-native services.
