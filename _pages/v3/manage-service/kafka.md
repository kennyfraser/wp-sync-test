Kafka is a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log service. It provides the functionality of a messaging system, but with a unique design. The Kafka DCOS service also has its own CLI as well.

# <a name="kafkainstall"></a>Installing Kafka on DCOS

**Prerequisite**

*   The DCOS CLI must be [installed][1].

1.  From the DCOS CLI, enter this command to install the Kafka DCOS service and CLI:

        $ dcos package install kafka


    **Tip:** It can take a few minutes to download and complete deployment, depending on your internet connection.

2.  Verify that Kafka is installed:

    *   From the DCOS CLI: `dcos package list`
    *   View the Kafka CLI command options: `dcos kafka help`
    *   From the DCOS web interface, go to the **Services** tab and confirm that the Kafka is running. ![][2]

# <a name="uninstall"></a>Uninstalling Kafka

1.  From the DCOS CLI, enter this command:

        $ dcos package uninstall kafka


2.  Open the Zookeeper Exhibitor web interface at `<hostname>/exhibitor`, where `<hostname>` is the [Mesos Master hostname][3].

    1.  Click on the **Explorer** tab and navigate to the `kafka-mesos` folder.

    2.  Click the **Modify** button on the lower-left side ofÂ browser.

    3.  Choose Type **Delete**, enter the required **Username**, **Ticket/Code**, and **Reason** fields, and click **Next**.

        <a href="https://docs.mesosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/zkkafkadelete.png" rel="attachment wp-att-1393"><img src="https://docs.mesosphere.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/zkkafkadelete-600x331.png" alt="zkkafkadelete" width="300" height="166" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-1393" /></a>

    4.  Click **OK** to confirm your deletion.

    5.  If a broker is added to Kafka, repeat steps 1-3 for `admin`, `brokers`, `config`, `consumers`, and `controller_epoch` folders. And if it exists, the `controller` znode.

        **Optional:** By default the Kafka broker logs are written into their Mesos task sandboxes, which are automatically cleaned up if necessary. If you created your brokers by using `--options log.dirs` to specify an alternative log location, you must clear that data manually to completely uninstall Kafka:

        1.  Identify the agent nodes that were running your Kafka brokers using the Mesos UI.

        2.  [SSH into each broker agent][4] and delete the data written to the directory you specified with the `--options log.dirs` option.
