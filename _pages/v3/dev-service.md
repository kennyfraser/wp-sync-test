This section describes the developer-specific DCOS components, explaining what is necessary to package and provide your own service on DCOS.

The Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) provides the optimal user experience possible for orchestrating and managing a datacenter. If you are an Apache Mesos developer, you are already familiar with developing a framework. DCOS extends Apache Mesos by including a web interface for health checks and monitoring, a command-line, a service packaging description, and a \[repository\]\[1\] that catalogs those packages.
