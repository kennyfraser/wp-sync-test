DCOS is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated setup file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during configuration. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to deploy a customized DCOS build.

The DCOS installation creates these folders:

*   `/opt/mesosphere`
    
    Contains all the DCOS binaries, libraries, cluster configuration. Do not modify.

*   `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants`
    
    Contains the systemd services which start the things that make up systemd. These files must be located outside of `/opt/mesosphere` because of systemd limitations.

*   `/etc/systemd/system`
    
    Copies of the units in `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants` must also be located in `/etc/systemd/system` due to a known systemd search path limitation. These units are prefixed with `dcos`.

The DCOS installation process requires a cluster of nodes to install DCOS onto and a single node to run the DCOS installation from.

You can use the automated installer or manual installer.
