The Services page provides a comprehensive view of all of the services that you are running. You can view a graph that shows the allocation percentage rate for CPU, memory, or disk. You can filter services by health status or service name.

<a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ui-services-1-7.gif" rel="attachment wp-att-4123"><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ui-services-1-7-800x406.gif" alt="ui-services-1-7" width="800" height="406" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-4123" /></a>

By default all of your services are displayed, sorted by service name. You can also sort the services by health status, number of tasks, CPU, memory, or disk space allocated.

Clicking the service name opens the Services side panel, which provides CPU, memory, and disk usage graphs and lists all tasks using the service. Use the dropdown or a custom filter to sort tasks and click on details for more information. For services with a web interface, you can click **Open Service** to view it. Click on a task listed on the Services side panel to see detailed information about the task’s CPU, memory, and disk usage and the task’s files and directory tree.
