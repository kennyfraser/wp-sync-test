DCOS services are Marathon applications that are packaged and available from a [DCOS package repository][1]. Services may just be Marathon applications or they may be [Mesos frameworks][2] whose schedulers runs as Marathon applications.

Some services are Mesosphere-certified and officially maintained, while others are community contributed and supported. The following Mesos frameworks packaged as DCOS services are Mesosphere maintained: Cassandra, Chronos, HDFS, Kafka, Kubernetes, Marathon, Spark, and Velocity.
