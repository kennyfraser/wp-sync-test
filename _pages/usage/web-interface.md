The DCOS web interface provides a rich graphical view of your DCOS cluster. With the web interface you can view the current state of your entire cluster and DCOS services. The web interface is installed as a part of your DCOS installation.

There are three major views in the DCOS web interface: Dashboard, Services, and Nodes. Additionally, there are quick-launch icons on the lower-left navigation panel for starting the DCOS CLI, chat sessions, and the DCOS documentation.

In addition to the DCOS web interface, the following DCOS components have individual web interfaces:

*   Mesos: `<hostname>/mesos`
*   Marathon: `<hostname>/marathon`
*   Exhibitor: `<hostname>/exhibitor`
