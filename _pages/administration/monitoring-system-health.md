You can monitor the health of your cluster components from the DCOS web interface. The component health page provides the health status of all DCOS system components that are running in systemd. You can drill down by health status, host IP address, or specific systemd unit.

![alt text][1]

Possible health states are unhealthy and healthy.

*   **Healthy** All cluster nodes are healthy. The units are loaded and not in the "active" or "inactive" state.

*   **Unhealthy** One or more nodes have issues. The units are not loaded or are in the "active" or "inactive" state.

# System Health HTTP API Endpoint

The system health endpoint is exposed at port 1050:

    $ curl <host_ip>:1050/system/health/v1
    

## Known Issues

### Misinterpreting System Health by Unit

You can sort system health by systemd unit. However, this search can bring up misleading information as the service itself can be healthy but the node on which it runs is not. This manifests itself as a service showing "healthy" but nodes associated with that service as "unhealthy". Some people find this behavior confusing.

### Missing Cluster Hosts

The system health API relies on Mesos DNS to know about all the cluster hosts. It finds these hosts by combining a query from `mesos.master` A records as well as `leader.mesos:5050/slaves` to get the complete list of hosts in the cluster.

This system has a known bug where an agent will not show up in the list returned from `leader.mesos:5050/slaves` if the Mesos slave service is not healthy. This means the system health API will not show this host.

If you experience this behavior it's most likely your Mesos slave service on the missing host is unhealthy.

# Troubleshooting

If you have any problems, you can check if the diagnostics service is running by SSHâ€™ing to the Mesos leading master and checking the systemd status of the `dcos-ddt.service`.
