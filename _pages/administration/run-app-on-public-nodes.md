The native Marathon instance is configured to receive offers from the public agent nodes (`--mesos_role="slave_public"`). Marathon apps are configured to use unreserved resources and launch on private agent nodes (`--default_accepted_resource_roles="*"`).

*   To run a Marathon app on public agent nodes, you must set the `acceptedResourceRoles` property to:
    
    "acceptedResourceRoles":["slave_public"]

*   To run a Marathon app on any agent node type, you must set the `acceptedResourceRoles` property to:
    
    "acceptedResourceRoles":["slave_public", "*"]

For a comprehensive example of deploying an app in the public zone to route HTTP requests, see [Deploying a Containerized App on a Public Node][1].
