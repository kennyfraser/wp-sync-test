The DCOS is based on <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/" target="_blank">Mesos</a> and includes a distributed systems kernel with enterprise-grade security. It also includes a set of core system services, such as a native [Marathon][1] instance to manage processes and installable services, and [Mesos-DNS][2] for service discovery. The DCOS provides a web interface and a command-line interface (CLI) to manage the deployment and scale of your applications.
