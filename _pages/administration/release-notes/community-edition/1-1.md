<p>The release notes provide a list of useful topics and links for Mesosphere DCOS.</p>

<h1>What's New</h1>

<p>DCOS 1.1 contains the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>CoreOS <a href="https://coreos.com/releases/#717.3.0">717&#046;3.0</a> </li>
<li>Mesos <a href="http://mesos.apache.org/blog/mesos-0-22-0-released">0&#046;22.1</a> </li>
<li>Marathon <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon/releases/tag/v0.9.1">0&#046;9.1</a></li>
<li>Mesos-DNS <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/mesos-dns/releases/tag/v0.1.2">0&#046;1.2</a></li>
</ul>

<h1>DCOS Services</h1>

<ul>
<li>New node and service side panels allow you to troubleshoot individual tasks from within the DCOS UI.</li>
<li>Significant updates to DCOS Services: Kubernetes (1.0.3), Marathon (0.11.1), Chronos (2.4.0), HDFS (0.1.4), Spark (1.5.0). </li>
</ul>

<h1>Known Issues and Limitations</h1>

<ul>
<li>There are sporadic failures in deploying some DCOS services (the fetcher seems to be killed partway through downloading resources). The exact cause is being investigated. Retrying a couple of times resolves the problem.</li>
<li><code>MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY</code> is not currently set on tasks launched with the Mesos Containerizer, but it should be. This generally doesn't affect tasks because the older, deprecated form, <code>MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY</code> is still set, and programs using libmesos will find that. See <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-3751">MESOS-3751</a> for tracking.</li>
