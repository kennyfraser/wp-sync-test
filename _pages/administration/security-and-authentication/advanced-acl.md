You can define fine-grained access to applications that are running in DCOS by defining advanced ACL groups. Advanced ACL groups can provide multi-tenancy by isolating application teams, and individual users. You can also control customized access to applications, for example read-only access. This access is administered on the backend by Admin Router and the native Marathon instance.

Authorization is not secure, but provides user isolation. Anything running inside the cluster, and anyone SSHâ€™d into it, has access to everything.

By default, when you install a DCOS service, an entry is created in the ACL for that particular service. For example, when you install Kafka, this ACL entry is created:

    dcos:adminrouter:service:kafka
    

You can create advanced ACL groups for each role in your organization.

To create an advanced ACL group:

1.  Launch the DCOS web interface and login with your Admin username and password.

2.  Click on the **System** tab, select **Organization**, and then **Groups**.

3.  Click **New Group** button and provide a name for your group.

4.  Open the new group and click **Advanced ACLs**.

5.  Define your advanced ACL by providing Resource and Permission and then click **Add Rule**.
    
    **Resource** A resource has this format: `dcos:<service-type>:<service-name>:<namespace>/<object-id>`, where:
    
    *   **dcos**: The required prefix.
    *   **service-type**: The service type can be: 
        *   `service` - resources defined by a DCOS service such as Cassandra.
        *   `adminrouter` - resources defined by Admin Router, such as locations.
        *   `acs` - resources defined by the access control service.
        *   `superuser` - superusers are allowed to do everything.
    *   **service-name** An [RFC 3986 (URI)][1] compliant name. For example, `dcos:service:kafka`. 
    *   **namespace** The namespace can be: 
        *   `services` - Marathon ACLs. 
        *   `admin` - Admin Router ACLs.
    
    **Permission** The type permissions assigned to the resource.
    
    *   `create` - Create an application. 
    *   `delete` - Delete an application. 
    *   `full` - Full CRUD access. This is the only available option for the `admin` namespace. 
    *   `read` - Read-only access to an application. 
    *   `update` - Update an application.

# Examples

In this example, a group is created that has access to all Marathon services in DCOS, where `<service-type>` is `marathon`, `<service-name>` is `marathon`, `<namespace>` is `services`, and `<object-id>` is `/`.

    dcos:service:marathon:marathon:services/
    

In this example, a group is created that has access to the `user-marathon` instance `production` subgroup, where `<service-type>` is `marathon`, `<service-name>` is `user-marathon`, `<namespace>` is `services`, and `<object-id>` is `/production`.

    dcos:service:marathon:user-marathon:services/production
    

In this example, a group is created that has access to the `user-marathon` instance `production/product1` subgroup, where `<service-type>` is `marathon`, `<service-name>` is `user-marathon`, `<namespace>` is `services`, and `<object-id>` is `/production/product1`.

    dcos:service:marathon:user-marathon:services/production/product1
    

In this example, a superuser group is created that has access to evertyhing in DCOS, where `<service-type>` is `superuser`, `<service-name>` is `superuser`, `<namespace>` is `superuser`, and `<object-id>` is `superuser`. This group is created by default.

    dcos:superuser
