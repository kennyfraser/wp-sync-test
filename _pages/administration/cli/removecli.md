1.  Delete your DCOS CLI installation directory.

2.  Delete the hidden `.dcos` directory. This will delete the configuration files for your DCOS services. By default, this directory is located in your home directory. For example, `/Users/<your username>/.dcos/` on OS X or `C:\Users\<your username>\.dcos` on Windows.
