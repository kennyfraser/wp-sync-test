Before installing DCOS, you must prepare your bootstrap node that is will be used to run the DCOS installation commands. A bootstrap node is any physical, virtual, or cloud machine. It must have IP-to-IP connectivity from the bootstrap node to all nodes in your cluster environment. Your bootstrap node must not be a part of your cluster.
