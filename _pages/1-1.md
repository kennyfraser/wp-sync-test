The release notes provide a list of useful topics and links for Mesosphere DCOS.

# What's New

DCOS 1.1 contains the following components:

*   CoreOS [717\.3.0][1] 
*   Mesos [0\.22.1][2] 
*   Marathon [0\.9.1][3]
*   Mesos-DNS [0\.1.2][4]

# DCOS Services

*   New node and service side panels allow you to troubleshoot individual tasks from within the DCOS UI.
*   Significant updates to DCOS Services: Kubernetes (1.0.3), Marathon (0.11.1), Chronos (2.4.0), HDFS (0.1.4), Spark (1.5.0). 

# Known Issues and Limitations

*   There are sporadic failures in deploying some DCOS services (the fetcher seems to be killed partway through downloading resources). The exact cause is being investigated. Retrying a couple of times resolves the problem.
*   `MESOS_NATIVE_JAVA_LIBRARY` is not currently set on tasks launched with the Mesos Containerizer, but it should be. This generally doesn't affect tasks because the older, deprecated form, `MESOS_NATIVE_LIBRARY` is still set, and programs using libmesos will find that. See [MESOS-3751][5] for tracking.
*   See additional known issues at <a href="https://support.mesosphere.com" target="_blank">support.mesosphere.com</a>.
