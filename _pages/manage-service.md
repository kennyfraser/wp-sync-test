DCOS services are Mesosphere-certified applications that are packaged and available from the public [GitHub package repositories][1]. Available DCOS services include Mesosphere-certified Mesos frameworks and other applications. A [Mesos framework][2] is the combination of a Mesos scheduler and an optional custom executor.

DCOS services are created by the community and by Mesosphere. The Mesosphere-certified applications are: Cassandra, Chronos, HDFS, Kafka, Kubernetes, Marathon, and Spark.
