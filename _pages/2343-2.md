This topic provides instructions for installing DCOS in your environment by using a customized Bash install script.

The DCOS installation creates these folders:

*   `/opt/mesosphere`
    :   Contains all the DCOS binaries, libraries, cluster configuration. Do not modify.

*   `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants`
    :   Contains the systemd services which start the things that make up systemd. They must live outside of `/opt/mesosphere` because of systemd constraints.

*   Various units prefixed with `dcos` in `/etc/systemd/system`
    :   Copies of the units in `/etc/systemd/system/dcos.target.wants`. They must be at the top folder as well as inside `dcos.target.wants`.

The DCOS Enterprise Edition is installed in your environment by using a dynamically generated setup file. This file is generated by using specific parameters that are set during installation. This installation file contains a Bash install script and a Docker container that is loaded with everything you need to create a customized DCOS build.

Contact your sales representative or <sales@mesosphere.io> to obtain the DCOS setup file.
